# Getting Started



# Objective
To predict the log-transformed price of Airbnb properties by analyzing various features, including room type, number of bathrooms, and review scores.

#Workflow
Understanding Business Requirements: Collaborated with stakeholders to determine key objectives.

# ETL Process:
Addressed null values using methods like mean, median imputation, and KNN Imputer.
Treated outliers with IQR-based techniques.
Feature encoding for categorical variables.


# EDA and Visualization:
Visualized correlations and data distributions.
Box plots and heatmaps to identify trends.


# Modeling:
Built linear regression models with features selected based on domain knowledge and data correlations.
Evaluated model performance on train and test datasets.

# Technologies Used
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python.

# Results
Achieved a model score of up to 44% accuracy on test data after outlier treatment and imputation.
Enhanced understanding of features impacting property prices.
